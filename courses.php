                    <p>This course aims to train a student in contemporary television production skills, radio
                        production, multimedia and web designing. The course is taught by dedicated professionals with a
                        wide range of industry experience. When possible, their skills are supplemented by a visiting
                        artist program, bringing industry professionals of national and international repute to the
                        academic program to work alongside both staff and students. The emphasis of the course is on
                        learning through practical experience and training. From their first day, students are "hands
                        on" with facilities, and this continues throughout the two years. The course enjoys a direct
                        relationship with the media industry through an active internship program where students take
                        part in professional placements as part of their study. This further enhances the practical
                        aspect of their study. Apart from this the course provides advanced training in Radio, TV and
                        Web Journalism. The training will include skills in writing, recording and editing and
                        presentation of news and topical programmes such as current affairs and panel discussion. . </p>
