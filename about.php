                                <p>Sri Siddhartha Education Society (SSES) was established in the year 1959 by Shikshana
                                    Bheeshma Sri H. M. Gangadharaiah, Founder Secretary with the blessings of Acharya

                                    then established several nursery, primary and high schools including Pali schools in

                                    the society is to “REACH THE UNREACHED” in the field of Education. The Society takes
                                    pride that the outgoing students of its institutions have all found successful
